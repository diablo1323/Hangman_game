# Hangman_game
These two codes let the user play the hangman game in a non-GUI and a GUI environment. The repository contains 2 python codes:

non-GUI_hangman.py: This code randomly selects a word from a list of words and lets the user guess the letters of the word and complete the whole word in less than 6 guesses, the code also tells how many guesses are left and how many letters the user can choose from.

GUI_hangman.py: This code runs in a GUI environment and is a graphic representation of the game with a stickman who gets closer to execution as the user enters a wrong guess.
